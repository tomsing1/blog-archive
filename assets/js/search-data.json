            "content": "To learn more about deep learning methods, I have begun working through the fastai book. . As always, the best way for me to learn is to dive into a small project of my own - an attitude strongly supported by the fastai authors. . The book uses image classification as an example, so I decided to look for a suitable image analysis project to help me learn. . Years ago, I studied the development of the fruitfly , especially the formation of its muscle system during embryogenesis. . . So I decided to return to my scientific roots and explore images of fruitfly embryogenesis. . The BDGP project . In 2009 the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project documented the expression patterns of most fruitfly genes using in situ hybridization. The researcherstook a large number of digital images of individual embryos, each stained with a specific probe to highlight the transcripts of one gene. . In total, the BDGP project examined 8532 genes and documented them with 140427 digital photographs. . Embryonic development takes about 22 hours and has been subdivided into separate stages discernable under the microscope. . . Here is the expression of one gene, Ecdysone-inducible gene L2 (* ImpL2*) at stage 7 of development, for example: . . Gene expression is dynamic, e.g. it changes over time as the embryo develops. To see how ImpL2 changes over time, check out the BDGP‚Äôs full report . After staining and imaging a large number of fruitfly embryos (Weiszmann et al, 2009), the researchers carefully . Identified single embryos in the field of view, and cropped the image accordingly. | Oriented each image so that the anterior end of the embryo faced left. | Assigned a developmental stage. | Described the (often complex) expression patterns they observed using a controlled vocabulary of anatomical terms. | Using this large image dataset, the BDGP project performed and published numerous analyses, e.g. . Global analysis of patterns of gene expression during Drosophila embryogenesis | . . Systematic image-driven analysis of the spatial Drosophila embryonic expression landscape | A quantitative spatiotemporal atlas of gene expression in the Drosophila blastoderm | . and many more. . The images have been made available publicly, e.g. via this site - 250 GB of image data in total. . Other researchers have used this resource and implemented machine learning models, e.g. . Automated annotation of developmental stages of Drosophila embryos | . Unfortunately, the FTP server requires a login/password, which is not provided on the page. The contacts form seems to be broken (not surprising for a website of a research project conducted more than 10 years ago). . I contaced Susan Celniker, a researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laborator and key driver of the Drosophila genome / BDGP efforts to see if she could help me out ü§ûüèª. . Fly-FISH . Another project used fluorescent microscopy to generate even higher resolution images of gene expression patterns during fruitfly embryogenesis: Fly-FISH . The images have sub-cellular resolution and are beautiful: .",

            "title": "Diving into python (again)",
            "content": "When I first started to use computational methods as a PhD student, python was the first programming language I learned. I loved both it‚Äôs clear syntax and the philosophy behind it. More recently, I have mainly been using R for my analyses, but still return to python e.g. to write multi-step workflows e.g. using Snakemake or Luigi. . In 2018, I had a chance to attend the fastai course taught by Jeremy Howard at the University of San Francisco. It was a great introduction into the field, but unfortunately I didn‚Äôt find the time to dive more deeply into it. Luckily, the fastai team just published much of their material as a book and also made the underlying Jupyter notebooks available. Time for another deep dive into neural networks, python, Jupyter notebooks, Numpy an more! . First, I needed to remind myself of a few features of python, e.g. the different types of methods used in object oriented programming or how to use the relatively recent pathlib standard module. . Here are a few online resources I found helpful: . Python . Virtual environments | Instance, class and static methods | Paths in python &gt;= 3.4 and this handy cheat sheet | Python string formatting | . Working in Jupyter . Jupyter debugger | . Numpy . Indexing arrays | Axes | . Matplotlib . Tutorial A Figure object is the outermost container for a matplotlib graphic, which can contain multiple Axes objects. One source of confusion is the name: an Axes actually translates into what we think of as an individual plot or graph. . | . Graphviz . Examples | .",
