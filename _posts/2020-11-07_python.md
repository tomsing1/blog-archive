When I first started to use computational methods as a PhD student, python was the first programming language I learned. I loved both it's clear syntax and the philosophy behind it. More recently, I have mainly been using R for my analyses, but still return to python e.g. to write multi-step workflows e.g. using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/) or [Luigi](https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

In 2018, I had a chance to attend the [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/) course taught by Jeremy Howard at the University of San Francisco. It was a great introduction into the field, but unfortunately I didn't find the time to dive more deeply into it. Luckily, the fastai team just published much of their material as a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527) and also
made the underlying [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) available. Time for another deep dive into neural networks, python, Jupyter notebooks, Numpy an more!

First, I needed to remind myself of a few features of python, e.g. the different types of methods used in object oriented programming or how to use the relatively recent [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) standard module. 

Here are a few online resources I found helpful:

## Python

- [Virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
- [Instance, class and static methods](https://realpython.com/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/)
- [Paths in python >= 3.4](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/) and this [handy cheat sheet](https://github.com/chris1610/pbpython/blob/master/extras/Pathlib-Cheatsheet.pdf)
- [Python string formatting](https://realpython.com/python-string-formatting/)

## Working in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

- [Jupyter debugger](https://github.com/jupyterlab/debugger)

## Numpy

- [Indexing arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.indexing.html#arrays-indexing
)
- [Axes](https://aerinykim.medium.com/numpy-sum-axis-intuition-6eb94926a5d1)

## Matplotlib

- [Tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/)
  > A Figure object is the outermost container for a matplotlib graphic, which can contain 
  multiple Axes objects. One source of confusion is the name: an `Axe`s actually 
  translates into what we think of as an individual plot or graph.

## Graphviz
